  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>CosmoLog is more than a tracker — it’s a living 
    archive of humanity’s journey to the stars. Here, 
    real history and speculative imagination meet in 
    one platform. We chronicle the triumphs and trials 
    of actual space programs while also venturing into 
    the “what if” worlds of science fiction, where 
    interstellar travel and advanced experiments push 
    beyond today’s limits.    
    Our mission is to bring context and curiosity together. 
    You’ll find records of legendary launches, the bravery 
    of crewed missions, and the quiet brilliance of experiments 
    conducted in orbit and beyond. Alongside these, you’ll 
    discover visionary sci-fi expeditions — imagined futures 
    that inspire innovation, cautionary tales that explore the 
    risks of discovery, and speculative science that stretches 
    our understanding of what might one day be possible.
    CosmoLog is designed to highlight not just the technical 
    details, but the human stories behind space exploration: 
    the ingenuity of engineers, the perseverance of astronauts, 
    the creativity of scientists, and the shared dream of 
    reaching further into the cosmos. By combining real missions 
    with fictional ones, we create a unique tapestry that 
    celebrates exploration in all its forms.
    Whether you’re here to study data, revisit milestones, 
    or get inspired by bold futures, CosmoLog invites you 
    to journey with us — from the launch pads of Earth to 
    the farthest frontiers of imagination.</p>
